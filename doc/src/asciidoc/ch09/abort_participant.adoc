== AbortParticipant

Imagine you have a list of participants that define a transaction, for example:

* +ValidateMessage+ (sanity checks)
* +FetchData+ (i.e. get Terminal/Merchant info from database)
* +QueryRemoteHost+
* +LogTransaction+
* +SendResponse+

If everything goes okay and all participants return +PREPARED+, then you'll have
no problem reaching the last set of participants. By contrast, if for some
reason a given participant fails (e.g., imagine +FetchData+ fails), then the
remaining participants down the list (in our example, FetchData through
+SendRepsonse+) won't get called because the transaction manager will initiate
the aborting procedure (which will call abort(id,context) only on the
previously-called participants, i.e., only on ValidateMessage in our example).

In the previous example, while it's okay to ignore a call to the
+QueryRemoteHost+ participant, you may still want to send a response 
back to the client, or even log the transaction, so you do want to call
+SendResponse+.

The
link:http://jpos.org/doc/javadoc/org/jpos/transaction/AbortParticipant.html[AbortParticipant]
is designed to solve this problem:

[source,java]
-------------
public interface AbortParticipant extends TransactionParticipant {
    public int  prepareForAbort (long id, Serializable context);
}
-------------

Participants implementing the +AbortParticipant+ will get called even if the transaction
is bound to abort.

[TIP]
=====
If we use this technique to implement a +SendResponse+ participant, as an additional
protection it is a good idea to verify that we are not approving a transaction.
=====

[NOTE]
======
As of jPOS 2.1.0 the `prepareForAbort` has a default implementation that
calls the TransactionParticipant's `prepare` method.
======

If you see the previous diagram, when participant 3 returns `ABORTED`, the last
participant doesn't get called. If participant number four implements this
`AbortParticipant` interface, the diagram would look like this:
