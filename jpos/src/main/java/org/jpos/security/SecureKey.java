/**
 * Represents a key that cannot be used except by your security module and for
 * performing the operations allowed by the security module for this type 
 * of keys.
 *
 * So, a SecureKey can be safely stored in a clear file or database.
 *
 * <p>
 * A SecureKey is typically a key encrypted under one of the secret keys that are
 * protected by the security module itself (Local Master Keys --LMK for short).<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * SecureKey just holds:<br>
 * 1- Secure Key: a byte[] holding the key in the secure proprietary format
 *    of your security module. This is typically the clear key encrypted under LMK.<br>
 * 2- Key Type: identifies what this key can be used for (e.g. TYPE_ZPK
 *    (Zone PIN Key), TYPE_ZMK (Zone Master Key)...<BR>
 * 3- Key Length (in bits): also called key size. e.g. LENGTH_DES, LENGTH_DES3_2KEY,...etc.
 *    This is not necessarily deducible from the length of the byte[] holding
 *    the secure key bytes, since encryption under LMK is proprietary to the
 *    security module.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The security of SecureKey is totally dependent on the security of
 * the used security module.
